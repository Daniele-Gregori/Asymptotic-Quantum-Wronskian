- Asymptotic Q functions Nf=3: Boundary condition for the quantum Wronskian of Confluent Heun equation, in terms of N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) Nf=3 gauge prepotential.

  This code computes the asymptotic behaviour of Baxter's Q functions, solutions of the quantum Wronskian, defined as regularized integrals through Ordinary Differential Equations / Integrable Models (ODE/IM) correspondence. Then by mapping the ODE parameter u into the gauge period a (through Matone's relation), the Q functions get expressed in terms of gauge periods a,A_D and prepotential F, for  Nf=3 SU(2) Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) N=2 gauge theory. The asymptotic expansion is double, at leading order in gauge deformation parameter h->0  and at second order O(Λ^2) in instanton parameter Λ->0 .  Our results from ODE/IM match perfectly analogue ones found previously through Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa (AGT) duality.
